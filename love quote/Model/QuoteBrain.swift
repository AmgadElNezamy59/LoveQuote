    let quote = ["As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once."
                 , "Loved you yesterday, love you still, always have, always will."
                 , "I saw that you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more."
                 ,"I love you not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you. I love you not only for what you have made of yourself, but for what you are making of me. I love you for the part of me that you bring out"
                 ,"Thinking of you keeps me awake. Dreaming of you keeps me asleep. Being with you keeps me alive"
                 ,"I need you like a heart needs a beat."
                 ,"When I say I love you more, I don’t mean I love you more than you love me. I mean I love you more than the bad days ahead of us, I love you more than any fight we will ever have. I love you more than the distance between us, I love you more than any obstacle that could try and come between us. I love you the most."
                 ,"If I know what love is, it is because of you"
                 ,"I fell in love with her courage, her sincerity, and her flaming self respect. And it’s these things I’d believe in, even if the whole world indulged in wild suspicions that she wasn’t all she should be. I love her and it is the beginning of everything"
                 ,"I swear I couldn’t love you more than I do right now, and yet I know I will tomorrow."
                 ,"If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you."
                 ,"A man is already halfway in love with any woman who listens to him."
                 ,"I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul."
                ,"Women are meant to be loved, not to be understood"
                 ,"There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, throbbing moment."
                 ,"Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own"
                 ,"Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don’t know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings."
                 ,"To love is to burn, to be on fire"
                 ,"Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up."
                 ,"Love is an untamed force. When we try to control it, it destroys us. When we try to imprison it, it enslaves us. When we try to understand it, it leaves us feeling lost and confused."
                 ,"You know you’re in love when you can’t fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams."
                 ,"The best love is the kind that awakens the soul; that makes us reach for more, that plants the fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds. That’s what I hope to give you forever."
                 ,"I would rather spend one lifetime with you, than face all the ages of this world alone"
                 ,"To be your friend was all I ever wanted; to be your lover was all I ever dreamed."
                 ,"Love is the strange bewilderment which overtakes one person on account of another person."
                 ,"Flatter me, and I may not believe you. Criticize me, and I may not like you. Ignore me, and I may not forgive you. Encourage me, and I will not forget you. Love me and I may be forced to love you."]
